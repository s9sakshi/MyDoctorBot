# MyDoctorBot

Looking to the current scenario of COVID-19 we are witnessing many things going around the world and among those there’s one thing that we observed very closely and thought of doing something for that. 
Nowadays even if people have normal symptoms which matches to Covid-19 but they are not infected with it are going to the hospitals and it’s not possible to treat them all at a time and again people who don’t have that much strong symptoms those people are taking treatment at their home or native place and not directly in hospital. In this scenario how it can be possible to make contact between doctor and patient easily and efficiently? 
So, we came up with our project as a solution.

Project Details:
We will be implementing an application integrated with a Chatbot for making interaction with patient and doctor.
1.	When patient will describe his/her symptoms to it then bot will replay with the disease you can have and what precaution are there that you have to take according to it.
2.	As Ayurveda and homeopathy is doing great work for covid-19 patients our bot will recommend some home remedies and ayurvedic medicines for certain symptoms and diseases for covid-19 as well as for normal patients.
3.	Along with Ayurveda and homeopathy it will suggest some antibiotic also and can generate prescription for reference so that when patient will contact medical store and there will not be any difficulty to purchase medicines. 
4.	If symptoms are more harmful to health then it will give suggestion to consult the hospital directly.
